# Crop.py

The Smart Crop-Management System

## Description

**Crop.py** is a smart, end-to-end crop management system.
It provides actionable recommendations for your crop needs, gives you additional information for crops, and provides a simple, easy-to-use platform for buyers to connect to farmers.

### Reasoning
The situation in Indian Agriculture, and particularly farmer distress, is increasingly getting the focus, reaching centre stage in The Media and public discourse; at long last, Agriculture is showing signs of getting the attention it richly deserves; for too long we Urban Indians have ignored Indian Agriculture. Our team aims to tackle this issue by using machine learning to eradicate old-school myths and act as reliable source for farmers to get information regarding a wide variety of crops catered to their environment. 

### Problems we aim to tackle
- **Low penetration of high-yield Hybrid varieties, proper varieties attuned to Indian Climate**; varieties for rainfed . irrigated, saline, alkaline, loamy soil etc etc; their awareness among farmers and their availability.
- **Re-planting of Seeds**, right seeds for right areas
- **Unscientific Agricultural Techniques** ```Note: this has absolutely no relation with technology, which is immaterial insofaras this problem is concerned; mechanization has little direct relation with productivity, which is a straight function of inputs - Soil, Water, Nutrients, Agronomical Techniques, Air and Sunlight.```  
This spans crop rotation as well as other agronomical approaches.
- **Quality of Soil** in some tracts of India.



### Detail
- #### Recommendation System
Crop.py gives actionable recommendations based on soil data, time-series weather and temperature data.
